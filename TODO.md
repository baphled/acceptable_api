* Work out if I need to use Sinatra or if I could strip out the routing
stuff - that's just about all I've used.

* Support other HTTP verbs. How could I create a Document from a POSTed
`application/vnd.acme.document-v1+xml`?

* Better documentation.

* A real test-driven codebase instead of the spike I've pulled together
here.

* Do we need to consider HATEOAS style resource links in AcceptableApi or is
that for a different project? Is anything special needed at all for this?
